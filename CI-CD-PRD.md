# Product Requirements Document: Comprehensive CI/CD Pipeline

## 1. Objective

To create a robust, automated CI/CD pipeline for the trading mentorship website that ensures high-quality, performant, and reliable deployments to Vercel. This pipeline will automate testing, optimization, and deployment processes, enforcing quality gates at every step.

## 2. Background

The trading mentorship website is a client-facing platform designed to attract and onboard new students. Its performance, reliability, and user experience are critical for business success. Currently, the deployment process is manual, lacking automated checks for performance, code quality, and asset optimization.

Implementing a CI/CD pipeline will:
- **Improve Load Performance:** By automatically compressing files, we can significantly reduce page load times.
- **Enforce Quality Standards:** Automated Lighthouse checks will ensure the site consistently meets high performance, accessibility, and SEO standards.
- **Increase Reliability:** A standardized, automated process reduces the risk of human error during deployment.
- **Streamline Development:** Any commit pushed to the `main` branch will automatically trigger the pipeline, ensuring all changes are vetted and deployed seamlessly.

## 3. Requirements

### 3.1. Core Pipeline Jobs

The CI/CD pipeline must execute the following jobs in sequence:

1.  **Dependency Installation:** The pipeline must install all necessary dependencies defined in `package.json`.
2.  **File Compression:**
    -   **HTML:** Minify `index.html`.
    -   **CSS:** Minify `styles.css`.
    -   **JavaScript:** Minify `script.js`.
    -   **Images:** Compress and optimize any images (if any are added in the future).
3.  **Lighthouse Audit:**
    -   Run a Lighthouse audit on the live or a preview deployment.
    -   The audit must check for **Performance**, **Accessibility**, **Best Practices**, and **SEO**.
    -   The pipeline must **fail** if any of these four metrics score **below 90**.
4.  **Deployment:**
    -   If all previous jobs succeed, the pipeline must deploy the optimized build to Vercel.
    -   The deployment should be linked to the specific commit that triggered the pipeline.

### 3.2. Triggers

-   The pipeline must automatically trigger on every `git push` to the `main` branch.

### 3.3. Environment & Tooling

-   **CI/CD Platform:** GitHub Actions will be used to define and run the pipeline.
-   **Compression Tools:** Use popular and well-maintained tools for minification (e.g., `html-minifier`, `clean-css`, `uglify-js`).
-   **Lighthouse:** Use the official Lighthouse CLI or a dedicated GitHub Action.
-   **Deployment:** Use the official Vercel CLI and Vercel for GitHub integration.

## 4. Task Checklist

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Configuration

-   [ ] **Initialize `package.json`:** The current `package.json` is empty. Initialize it properly using `npm init -y`.
-   [ ] **Install Dependencies:**
    -   [ ] Install development dependencies for file compression: `npm install html-minifier clean-css uglify-js --save-dev`.
    -   [ ] Install Lighthouse: `npm install -g @lhci/cli --save-dev`.
    -   [ ] Install Vercel CLI: `npm install vercel --save-dev`.
-   [ ] **Add NPM Scripts:** Create scripts in `package.json` to run the build and audit tasks.
    -   `"build:html"`: Script to minify `index.html`.
    -   `"build:css"`: Script to minify `styles.css`.
    -   `"build:js"`: Script to minify `script.js`.
    -   `"build"`: A script that runs all three `build:*` scripts in sequence.
    -   `"audit"`: Script to run the Lighthouse check.

### Phase 2: GitHub Actions Workflow

-   [ ] **Create Workflow File:** Create a `.github/workflows/main.yml` file to define the CI/CD pipeline.
-   [ ] **Define Trigger:** Configure the workflow to run on pushes to the `main` branch.
-   [ ] **Setup Environment:**
    -   [ ] Use a standard Node.js environment (e.g., `actions/setup-node@v3`).
    -   [ ] Add a step to checkout the repository code.
    -   [ ] Add a step to install NPM dependencies (`npm install`).
-   [ ] **Create Build Job:**
    -   [ ] Add a step to run the `npm run build` script.
    -   [ ] Ensure the output files are stored in a `dist` directory.
-   [ ] **Create Lighthouse Audit Job:**
    -   [ ] Configure the job to run `lhci autorun` or a similar command.
    -   [ ] Set the assertion criteria to fail the job if any score is below `0.9` (90%).
-   [ ] **Create Deployment Job:**
    -   [ ] Configure the job to only run if the Build and Audit jobs succeed.
    -   [ ] Use the Vercel for GitHub integration or the Vercel CLI to deploy the `dist` directory.
    -   [ ] Add required Vercel secrets (`VERCEL_ORG_ID`, `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`, `VERCEL_TOKEN`) to the GitHub repository secrets.

### Phase 3: Documentation & Finalization

-   [ ] **Update README:** Add a section to the `README.md` explaining the CI/CD pipeline, its purpose, and how it works.
-   [ ] **Testing:** Manually trigger the pipeline with a test commit to ensure all jobs execute as expected.
-   [ ] **Review & Merge:** Create a pull request with all the changes, review, and merge to `main`.
